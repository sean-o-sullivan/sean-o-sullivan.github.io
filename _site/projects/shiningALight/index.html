            <p><b>Description</b><p>
            <p>Our project aimed to assess the effectiveness of Covid-19 cleaning protocols in our school. We utilized a mixed methods approach: First, we analysed 106 student desks under UV light after cleaning with Glo Germ powder, measuring touched areas and the effectiveness of the cleaning using digital grids. Second, we surveyed 26 teachers and 180 students to gather their opinions on Covid-19 and the cleaning procedures. Lastly, we observed student cleaning behaviors, finding that they cleaned the deskâ€™s internal area more thoroughly than the perimeter. This comprehensive analysis provided insights into the cleaning protocols' effectiveness and areas needing improvement. Finally, in two testing groups, students who received both an instructional video and positive reinforcement from teachers cleaned their desks significantly better after one week compared to those who had only been shown the video.</p>
